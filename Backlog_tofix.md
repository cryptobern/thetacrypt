# Checklist

- Demo with docker âœ…
- Local spawn of processes to test the network ?
- proper readmes (fix this before than change code)
- push a nice version on the public GitHub
- Add the VRF (mainly for me to get the understanding of adding a new scheme + writing a guided file that explains how to)
- Add a file that explains how to include a new protocol
- Add the SchemeAPI
