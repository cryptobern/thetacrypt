This library is split into three main parts:
- The **schemes** layer: Implements the various threshold cryptography schemes
- The **protocols** layer: Uses the primitives from the schemes layer to create threshold cryptography protocols.
- The **network** layer: Used to exchange peer-to-peer messages between the participating parties.
