# The core layer

The core layer represent the heart of the service. It is composed by three modules:

- the **schemes module**: containing the implementation of the cryptographic primitives.
- the **protocols module**: implementing the protocol logic for each different type of cryptosystem.
- the **orchestration module**: managing concurrent protocol executions and handling the interaction with the other layers.

For detailed information check out the README of every module.
